## [v1.01] - we have the basics

### added:
  - the delete save button works now :)
  - added the amount of points you put into the interval value into the actual button

### changed:
  - changed some of the math, interval value is now calculated by (points*16)/50
  - increment upgrade value is now multiplied by 3.141
  - updated to break_eternty.js for bigger point
  - rewrote the save logic
  - edited css to make room for potential menus in the future

### bugs fixed:
  - values went all wacky when save was loaded

### things to add:
  - rebirthing (global multiplier for all points)
  - rebirth rebirthing (global multiplier for the global multiplier)
  - automatic upgrading???

now with saving !!

my first incremental game made with break eternity

it is not fun so have fun

i am not very good at math :)
